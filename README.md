# Heart-Disease-prediction
This is my project on heart disease prediction by using scikit learn library

Context
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. 
The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
